# SPSS scripts to preprocess Imagen Psytools data

Copyright (C) 2008-2010 Delosis

- These SPSS files have probably been used for the pilot phase of Imagen
  only, before 2010.
- Then the initial database team swiftly changed to a second generation of
  tools, SQL code applied to an intermediate PostgreSQL database. The code
  is poorly documented and the intermediate database has been discarded.
  BL and FU1 Psytools data available from the old Imagen XNAT server were
  probably processed using the SQL code.
- For FU2 and the past releases of the new Imagen v2 server, we switched
  to an unpublished Python script which is far from perfect.
- For FU3 and upcoming releases of the new Imagen v2 server, we want to
  re-use the
  [R scripts written by John Rogers for the c-VEDA project](https://github.com/delosis/psytools).

As you can see, these SPSS scripts are mainly of historical interest. They
are the first generation of tools used to preprocess Imagen Psytools data,
they were used as the basis of the Imagen
[_codebook_](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NAHDAP/support/faqs/2006/01/what-is-codebook)
that describes BL and FU1 Psytools data, and we have copied them here as
a mere reference.
